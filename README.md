# Seven Concepts Studio Virtual Business Card

This is a simple "virtual business card" developed for my mother's business. It is a simple static site, and is powered by Bootstrap5 and GitHub pages.

## Purpose

We were visited by some people from [Uno Green](https://shop.unogreen.in/) who offered virtual business cards with QR Codes/NFC facility. The salesman demonstrated to us by just tapping his phone on a demo card that quickly opened a site containing all important information about the business. 

It was really simple and good. The site acted like a portal for payment, address, contacts, and even a mini gallery where the business could put up photos of their shop and testimonials.

My mother who is a very hard lady to convince, actually liked it by the end and was eager - until he disclosed the costs.

The cheapest offering is around ₹999 for 1 card. It is made with plastic and would have logos of Uno Green on the front and back. You also cannot put your own company's logo. Just text.

The costliest offering is around ₹4,999 for 1 which was made of steel, with your/your company's name and logo engraved on the front, and the QR Code at the back. Fancy. The Uno Green logo would still be present at the back.

There are other options in between, with different colour options. All of them are NFC and QR code enabled.

## Goal

My goal was to recreate this in the cheapest way possible. It is a nice concept, but also simple enough that you can do it for yourself with little computer knowledge.

I decided to host a similar static site on GitHub pages for free. Hence, website costs reduced to 0. The next way was to implement the QR Code/NFC system.

For the QR code solution, we will just slightly modify our existing business cards and reprint them. 

I am experimenting with NFC. I ordered a few NFC stickers, will stick on the back of a simple non PVC card and test how reliable it is and how much stress it can handle.

## To Do

* Generator site: I made this within a day, with very limited knowledge of HTML and CSS. I would like to extend this and create a "generator" site or an app that lets users easily do it themselves without writing code.

## Thoughts

I think Uno Green should diversify their offerings. They should tone down on the NFC part, since NFC is NOT a thing in India. It is the reason why QR Code based UPI has succeeded so much. My Xiaomi Phone which I bought in January 2022 does not have NFC. They should offer economical plain business cards only with the QR code for the masses.

The most repulsive part perhaps is the mandatory Uno Green logo on all cards. Business Cards are supposed to be all about YOU. The fact that even their costliest offerings made with steel and engravings, have mandatory Uno Green logo destroys it's appeal to customers. They could offer different variants of the same card - one slightly less expensive without the Uno Green logo, and the other one without it.

One thing to note, is that NFC tech is extremely cheap, and basic simple PVC cards too do not cost over ₹900 to print. Total Production cost for the base variant is probably around ₹50. The NFC stickers that I ordered online cost ₹51 per piece. Bulk orders in an industry setting would probably cost even lower. I would bet the basic card takes only around ₹90 to produce at max.
